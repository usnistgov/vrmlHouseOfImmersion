# vrmlHouseOfImmersion
A repository for a historically interesting file we created at NIST to help test VRML1 plugins and browsers. We are resurrecting it in multiple formats for use by the web graphics (or anyone else) community.

The comments of the top of the original file state:
```javascript
#VRML V1.0 ascii
#House of Immersion Revision History
# 11/9/95 validated - Sandy
Separator {
	Separator {
		DEF Viewer Info {
			string "walk"
		    }
		DEF Title Info { string "The House of Immersion" }
		DEF SceneInfo Info {
		    string
"The VRML House of Immersion was created by:
Sandy Ressler (still at NIST)
Christine Piatko (at NIST)
it was based on the original Virtus Walkthrough
and Inventor versions by:
Sharon Davison (now at Microsoft)
Mark Pflaging  (now at GWU)
and
Alan Sun (now at MIT).
```

Organizations affiliations mentioned in the above comments are far out of date.

Other file format conversions of this file will be added.
